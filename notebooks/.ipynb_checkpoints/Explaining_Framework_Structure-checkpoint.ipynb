    "# LaneDetection_Framework Repository Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "The **LaneDetection_Framework** is a comprehensive framework for lane detection, designed to support efficient training and inference of deep learning models. It includes capabilities for single-GPU, multi-GPU (using Distributed Data Parallel), and CPU-based execution. The repository provides modular and extensible components for data processing, model training, and system configuration.\n",

    "   - Separates data handling, model implementation, and training logic for easy extensibility.\n",
    "3. **Flexible Configurations**:\n",
    "   - Configuration files enable easy switching between CPU, GPU, and distributed environments.\n",
    "4. **Performance Benchmarking**:\n",
    "   - Includes tools (e.g., Jupyter notebook) to evaluate different data handling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Project\n",
    "1. **Single-GPU Training**:\n",
    "   Configure `gpu_config.yaml` and execute the appropriate training script.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-GPU Training**:\n",
    "   Use `DDP_MultiGPU.py` with the `ddp_config.yaml` file.\n",
    "\n",
